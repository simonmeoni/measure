{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.", "output": "\nIt is possible that the infection is still present in your body, and it is recommended that you get examined by a doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the results of the examination, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve your symptoms. Additionally, you should practice safe sex and use condoms to reduce your risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "\nUnfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors such as the amount of cocaine used, the frequency of use, and the individual's metabolism. Generally, cocaine can stay in the body for up to 72 hours, but it can remain in the system for up to a week or more. It is also important to note that cocaine can remain in sperm for up to 5 days after use. Therefore, it is best to wait at least a week before trying to conceive to ensure that the cocaine is out of your system. Additionally, it is important to speak with your doctor about any potential risks associated with using cocaine while trying to conceive."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?", "output": "\nIt is normal to have some residual brown discharge after your period. This is usually caused by old blood that has been in the uterus for a while and is now being expelled. It is not usually a cause for concern. However, if the discharge is accompanied by any other symptoms such as pain, itching, or a foul odor, then you should see your doctor for further evaluation. As for the bleeding during sex, this could be caused by a number of things such as an infection or a hormonal imbalance. If it continues, you should see your doctor for further evaluation."}
