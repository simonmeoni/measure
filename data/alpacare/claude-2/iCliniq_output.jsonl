{"response": " I cannot provide medical advice without examining you in person, as that would be unethical and irresponsible. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you may have developed epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis (a coiled tube at the back of the testicle). This can sometimes occur after infections like mumps. The pain and swelling suggest ongoing inflammation. \n\nIt's possible the infection may still be present, especially if the symptoms have persisted or recurred after antibiotic treatment. I would recommend being evaluated by your doctor again. They can examine you, order tests if needed, and determine if further antibiotic treatment is warranted.\n\nWithout an exam, I cannot recommend specific antibiotics. Your doctor will be able to choose the most appropriate antibiotic based on the type of infection, your history, and local resistance patterns. Some common options for epididymitis include fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or cephalosporins like ceftriaxone. But your doctor will make the best recommendation.\n\nIn the meantime, scrotal support, anti-inflammatories, and rest may help provide some symptom relief. But you should follow up with your doctor soon for a re-evaluation and to make sure any infection is properly treated. Let me know if you have any other questions!", "prompt": "Human: If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\nHello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\nAssistant:"}
{"response": " I do not have enough medical details to provide specific medical advice. However, cocaine use can negatively impact fertility and pregnancy. It is best to stop using cocaine and other drugs, eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, avoid alcohol and tobacco, and see your doctor before trying to conceive. Sperm health can take around 3 months to improve after stopping cocaine. I would recommend speaking to your doctor for more guidance based on your specific health history.", "prompt": "Human: If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\nHello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:"}
{"response": " Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing some irregular bleeding after skipping your withdrawal bleeds for several months while on Yaz birth control pills. Here are a few points:\n\n- It's common to have breakthrough bleeding or spotting when you skip or delay withdrawal bleeds for an extended period of time on birth control pills. The brown discharge you're experiencing now is likely just residual bleeding clearing out.\n\n- As long as you are not having heavy bleeding that requires changing a pad frequently, or the bleeding is not accompanied by severe pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms, it is likely benign. \n\n- I would recommend continuing to take your active birth control pills as normal. The bleeding should stop within a few days. If it persists for more than 7-10 days or gets heavier, contact your doctor.\n\n- In the future, it's best not to skip more than 2-3 withdrawal bleeds in a row on birth control pills, as doing so can disrupt the stability of your uterine lining and lead to unpredictable bleeding. \n\n- Make sure to use a backup contraceptive method like condoms if you have breakthrough bleeding, as the pills may not be as effective at preventing pregnancy during this time.\n\nOverall, this sounds like typical breakthrough bleeding that should resolve soon. But let me know if you have any other concerns or the bleeding persists or worsens. In that case, making an appointment with your gynecologist to be evaluated may be a good idea.", "prompt": "Human: If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\nHello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?\n\nAssistant:"}
