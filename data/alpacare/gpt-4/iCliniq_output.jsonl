{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these symptoms. Your description suggests that you might have had orchitis, which is inflammation of one or both testes and common in people who get mumps after puberty. Orchitis can indeed result in a decrease in testicle size and potential fertility issues.\n\nWhile it's difficult to definitely say without an examination, the persistence of your symptoms does indicate there may be ongoing issues or complications like chronic epididymitis (inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle).\n\nIt is essential for you to see a urologist as soon as possible for further evaluation and management. They can perform ultrasound imaging studies or other tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Avoiding sexual activity till you visit and receive advice from the doctor would also be prudent.\n\nAs for antibiotics, it's best not to self-medicate as this requires a prescription based on a thorough assessment of infection type, severity and your overall health status. An inappropriate antibiotic usage could lead to resistance and make any lingering infection more difficult to treat.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or urologist immediately to address these concerns."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "Cocaine generally leaves the body within a few days. It is normally not detectable in blood or saliva tests after 1 to 2 days, and in urine tests it can be detected up to 3 days, but this can extend to about two weeks with heavy use. The half-life of cocaine is relatively short, about 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIn terms of impact on sperm, cocaine has been found to cause abnormalities in sperm shape, number, and movement, which could potentially affect fertility. There isn't a specific time frame linked to how long cocaine stays in sperm, as such effects depend on individual metabolism and frequency of use.\n\nWhile there aren't definitive guidelines for this situation, it's generally recommended for couples trying to conceive to avoid illicit drugs altogether, because of potential harm to both prospective parents and the potential child. It is advisable to seek further advice from your own healthcare provider who knows your personal circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider lifestyle choices that promote healthy fertility. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances can all help improve fertility outcomes.\n\nYou should share this information with your healthcare provider so they can provide you with accurate guidance based on their knowledge of your overall health condition.\n"}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?", "output": "It sounds like you're experiencing breakthrough bleeding, which can occur when the hormonal levels in your body fluctuate. When on oral contraceptives like Yaz, skipping sugar pills and prolonging the time before having a period can potentially lead to irregularities including breakthrough bleeding or spotting.\n\nThe brown discharge is likely old blood that didn't fully exit during your period. If it doesn't clear up within a few days to a week, or if you notice other symptoms like an unusual vaginal odor, itchiness, burning sensation, or pelvic pain, contact your healthcare provider as there could be another issue, such as infection or inflammation.\n\nAs for the bleeding during sex, this could also be related to breakthrough bleeding or might indicate cervical irritation. It should subside with your next menstrual cycle. Still, recurrent or heavy bleeding during sex warrants medical attention to rule out more serious conditions like polyps, infection, or rarely, cervical cancer.\n\nIf these conditions persist or cause concern, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider who might want to adjust your contraceptive regimen or investigate other causes behind these symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with your doctor for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."}
