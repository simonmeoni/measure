{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.", "output": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on your description. It is possible that the infection in your left testicle is related to the mumps infection you had five months ago. However, without a proper examination and medical history review by a healthcare professional, it would be difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. \n\nIf you are still experiencing pain and swelling in your testicle, it is important to have a follow-up evaluation with a doctor. They will be able to perform a physical examination, ask further questions about your symptoms, and possibly order additional tests such as blood work or imaging studies to help diagnose the underlying cause.\n\nAs for antibiotic recommendations, only a doctor can prescribe antibiotics after evaluating your condition. Taking an antibiotic without proper diagnosis and prescription may not be effective and could potentially contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. It is best to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As an AI language model, I can provide some general information, but it's important to note that I am not a doctor. If you have concerns or questions about drug use and its impact on fertility, I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional.\n\nCocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that can have detrimental effects on both male and female fertility. Cocaine use may affect sperm quality, including motility (movement) and morphology (shape), which could potentially reduce fertility. Additionally, cocaine use during pregnancy can pose serious risks to the developing fetus.\n\nThe exact time it takes for cocaine to completely leave the body varies depending on several factors, including the individual's metabolism, frequency of use, amount used, and overall health. Generally, cocaine is rapidly metabolized by the body, and its main metabolite, called benzoylecgonine, can be detected in urine for up to 2-4 days after use. However, traces of cocaine may be detectable in hair follicles for months to years.\n\nRegarding the presence of cocaine in sperm, limited research suggests that it may persist for up to three days after use but becomes undetectable within a week. It's important to remember that even if the direct presence of cocaine were no longer detectable, there could still be potential effects on sperm quality and fertility.\n\nTo ensure a safe and healthy environment for conception, it is generally recommended to discontinue drug use altogether, including cocaine."}
{"instruction": "", "input": "Hello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?", "output": "I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information. Breakthrough bleeding or spotting can occur when you skip the sugar pills and continue taking active hormonal pills for an extended period of time. By doing this, your uterine lining may become unstable, leading to irregular bleeding.\n\nThe brown discharge you are experiencing could be residual blood from your recent period or breakthrough bleeding. It is not uncommon for some women to have brown discharge for a few days up to a week after their period ends. If you recently had sex and experienced bleeding, it could have caused some minor trauma to the cervix or vaginal tissue, resulting in additional bleeding or spotting. \n\nHowever, any persistent or heavy bleeding, significant pain, or other abnormal symptoms should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. If you're concerned or if the bleeding continues beyond a week, it is recommended to reach out to your doctor or gynecologist for further evaluation and guidance. They will be able to provide a more accurate assessment, considering your specific medical history and circumstances."}
